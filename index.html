        <h2 class="page-heading">Proverbs 29</h2>

        <p class="page-subheading p-b-400">King James Version (KJV)</p>

        <div class="text">
          <p>
            <strong>1</strong> My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear
            to my understanding:
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>2</sup> That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips
            may keep knowledge.
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>3</sup> For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb,
            and her mouth is smoother than oil:
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>4</sup> But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged
            sword.
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>5</sup> Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>6</sup> Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways
            are moveable, that thou canst not know them.
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>7</sup> Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not
            from the words of my mouth.
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>8</sup> Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door
            of her house:
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>9</sup> Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years
            unto the cruel:
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>10</sup> Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy
            labours be in the house of a stranger;
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>11</sup> And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy
            body are consumed,
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>12</sup> And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart
            despised reproof;
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>13</sup> And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor
            inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>14</sup> I was almost in all evil in the midst of the
            congregation and assembly.
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>15</sup> Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running
            waters out of thine own well.
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>16</sup> Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of
            waters in the streets.
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>17</sup> Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with
            thee.
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>18</sup> Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife
            of thy youth.
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>19</sup> Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let
            her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always
            with her love.
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>20</sup> And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange
            woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>21</sup> For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord,
            and he pondereth all his goings.
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>22</sup> His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and
            he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.
          </p>

          <p>
            <sup>23</sup> He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness
            of his folly he shall go astray.
          </p>
